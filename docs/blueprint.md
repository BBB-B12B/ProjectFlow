# **App Name**: ProjectFlow

## Core Features:

- Project Overview Dashboard: Display an overview of all projects, including a 'New Project' button. Each project displays its name and description, and can be clicked for details.
- Task Management Dashboard: Display tasks within a selected project, grouped by status, along with a button to create new tasks. The tasks' title, priority and due date are clearly visible and individual tasks can be clicked for details and modification.
- Analytics Dashboard with Task Prioritization: Summarize all tasks, grouping them by status; also display a scatter plot to visualize tasks by 'Effort' vs. 'Effect,' offering a quick view of quick wins and major projects. This uses reasoning to offer custom prioritization advice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) to convey professionalism and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), offering a clean and modern look that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Teal (#14B8A6) to highlight important actions and elements, creating visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and highly readable user interface.
- Lucide Icons providing a consistent and modern visual language throughout the application. The icons are simple, elegant, and easy to understand.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to prevent visual clutter. Cards are used to group related information, improving readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., when opening dialogs or updating task statuses) to enhance the user experience and provide feedback. Use of tooltips on buttons when the text might not convey all of the context
